        program in console
         The value of clothes[0] is undefined because we declare the clothes.length = 0 which means no value in clothes array and also the length function start from 1 not from zero.      </p>
    <script>
        const clothes = ['jacket','t-shirt']
       clothes.length=0;
       console.log(clothes[0]);
